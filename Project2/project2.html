		<h1>Testimonials</h1>
		<article class="test">
			<p>I literally created an account and wrote my first Yelp review just for Ali and Benjamin, because of how amazing they were during our move today! They must have some sort of super powers because they managed to move an entire one bedroom apartment full of furniture and miscellaneous items from our old apartment to our new apartment in the matter of 2 hours - saving us both a LOT of time, energy and money. </p>

			<p>Moving is always a daunting prospect, but the trio from Dynamic more than lived up to their name. Efficient, energetic, and powerful, Ali and his team made moving a breeze - even in the sweltering summer heat of August in New York. </p>

			<p>I really wish I could give more than five stars for these movers.Moving from a fourth floor studio walk-up in the heat and humidity of New York summer, Ali and Ramish were absolutely amazing. Extremely efficient, strong, and fast, they hauled my heavy boxes down those flights of stairs; my stuff flew down to the moving van. They fit every single item into their van like magic! I really can't tell you how impressive this is.</p>

			<p>Ali and his team were AMAZING! I had most everything packed in boxes when they arrived and the three guys got to work quickly and very efficiently. I moved from a small studio to a larger studio and they were finished in three and a half hours on the dot. I have zero complaints. Highly recommend and if i move in the future, i will not hesitate to use this company again.</p>
