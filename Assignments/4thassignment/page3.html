        		<h1>A Clever Use of 3D Printing: Modular Magnetic Construction Set</h1>
        		<p>Situated in the vast Pacific Ocean is a 2,400 km chain of islands better known as Hawaii. Hawaii is unlike no other; every island, atoll, and islet have once been a monstrous volcano making each one of these places unique in every way possible.</p>
                <p>When most people hear Hawaii what usually comes to mind are the beautiful beaches of Waikiki â€“ Oahu to the oasis of Maui, yet many people haven't explored the garden isle of Kauai, or the volcanic hot spot of Hawaii.</p>        
        	 
        	
        		
        		<h1>North Shore</h1>
        		<p>Oahu and Maui are only the beginning to what is ready for exploration on the beautiful islands of Kauai, and Hawaii. Having been to all 4 major islands, I decided to post my top ten favorite spots to visit and explore on each island.</p>

        		<p>This scenic area on the island's north west coast is one of the most breathtaking naturally made coast lines in the world. It offers some of the most beautiful beaches. The Pali (cliffs) rise as high as 4,000 feet (1200m) above the beautiful pacific ocean. The coast can be enjoyed by hiking, boating (kayaks), and by air (either helicopter or small airplane). A definite must see!</p>
                <h1> Valley of the Temples</h1>
                <p>Located at the foot of the 2,000 ft. Koolau Mountains in the Valley of the Temples in Oahu's Kaneohe Region sits the beautiful Byodo-In Temple. The Byodo-In Temple was built in the 1960's to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the arrival of the first Japanese immigrant workers in Hawaii who came to work in the sugar plantation fields. It is a replica of the 950-year-old Byodoin Temple located in Uji, Japan on the southern outskirts of Kyoto.
