        		<p>At the heart of each Modular Magnetic set are magnets. Magnets not only serve as the “glue” which holds your creations together, but they also guide you along the way, allowing you to place objects only where they would normally belong in the real kitchen.</p>
                <h1>Simple & detailed versions</h1>
                <p>Depending on your requirements, MMK can be as simple or as detailed as you like, and although this set is designed to faithfully reproduce as much of the detail of the real kitchen as possible, in some cases this amount of detail might not be a fitting feature for your project.
