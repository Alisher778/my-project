<h1 id="main">Top 10 Fastest cars in the world</h1>
</div>

<section>
	
	<h1>Hennessey Venom GT (270 mph)</h1>
<p>Lotus Elise chassis and 1,244-hp 7.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8, and you have the fastest production car in the world. Depending on your definition of "fastest" and "production car", that is.
Hennessey recorded a 270.4-mph run at the Kennedy Space Center last year, but only in one direction. To be considered legitimate, record attempts usually require one run in each direction. An average is then taken to account for wind conditions.
</p>
<p>Because of its hand-built nature, there's also some debate about whether the Venom GT qualifies as a production car. While it can claim the highest recorded speed, Hennessey's monster isn't 
recognized as the world's fastest car by the Guinness Book of World Records.</p>

<h1>Bugatti Veyron Super Sport (268 mph)</h1>

<p>When Volkswagen purchased the Bugatti brand, it had one goal: build the fastest production car in the world. The original Veyron achieved that goal, and with a price tag of $1.7 million and a quad-turbocharged
 W16 engine producing 1,000 hp, it also boasted the most superlatives of any production car.</p>
<p>Yet the Veyron was soon dethroned by the SSC Ultimate Aero, so Bugatti came back with the Veyron Super Sport. This Veyron-plus has 1,200 hp, and numerous aerodynamic changes meant to help gain a few extra miles per hour.</p>
<p>With a top speed of 268 mph recorded at Volkswagen's Ehra-Lessein test track, the Veyron Super Sport is still recognized as the world's fastest production car by Guinness. The related Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse is also the world's
 fastest open-topped car, with a top speed of 254 mph.</p>

 
 <h1>SSC Ultimate Aero (256 mph)</h1>
 
<p>Briefly, the might of the Volkswagen Group and the prestige of the Bugatti name were bested by a car company no one had ever heard of.
Shelby SuperCars (SSC) has nothing to do with Carroll Shelby of Cobra fame, but for a moment its Ultimate Aero was the fastest production car in the world. It hit 256 mph in 2007, beating the non-Super Sport version of the Veyron
</p>
<p>Helping it achieve that velocity is a 6.3-liter twin-turbocharged V8 with 1,287 hp. There are no electronic driver aids to help control that power either, creating a purer driving experience for
 those with talent, and a scenario for certain death for those without it.</p>

 
<h1>Koenigsegg CCR (242 mph)</h1>

<p>Swedish supercar builder Koenigsegg briefly held the “world's fastest title before being bested by the original Bugatti Veyron. Its CCR reached 242 mph at Italy's Nardo Ring in 2005.
The CCR was essentially an earlier generation of the cars Koenigsegg is building today. It featured a 4.7-liter V8 of the company's own design, a carbon-fiber body, and not much in the way of electronic aids.
</p>
<p>Despite its impressive stats, the CCR's moment in the spotlight was as brief as its claim on the world. It was soon supplanted by the CCX, and then by the current Agera. Koenigsegg says the Agera-based One:1 
will top out at over 270 mph, but no one has tried it yet.</p>


<h1>McLaren F1 (241 mph)</h1>
<p>The F1 is more than just a former world's-fastest car. With its carbon-fiber body, gold-lined engine bay, 6.1-liter BMW M V12, and center driver's seat, it just might be the coolest car ever made.</p>
<p>Years before it attempted to take on Ferrari and Porsche with the MP4-12C, McLaren was known only as a successful race team in Formula 1 and the defunct Can-Am series. Yet its first road car wasn't exactly an amateur effort.</p>
<p>McLaren intended to make the F1 the ultimate road-going supercar, but its design was informed by the company's racing experience. The F1 even went on to a fairly successful racing career in its own right, winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1995.</p>

<h1>Aston Martin One-77 (220 mph)</h1>
<p>The One-77 is the most extreme road-going Aston ever, and the fastest. It may share a front-engined layout with “regular Astons, but the One-77 is a completely different animal.
Only 77 examples were made, and each sports a 7.30-liter V12 producing 750 hp. Like the chassis, it's based on an engine used in lesser Aston production models, but it's both lighter and more ferocious.
</p>
<p>Aside from its performance and jaw-dropping good looks, the most remarkable thing about the One-77 may be that Aston was able to create a hypercar without making many compromises.
While it matches race-inspired mid-engined designs for performance, the One-77 still has the look and feel of something much more luxurious and well-rounded. It is, after all, the only front-engined car on this list.
</p>
<p>The One-77 proves that incredibly fast cars don't have to focus solely on performance. Its character is almost as special as its 220 mph top speed and limited production run.</p>

<h1>Jaguar XJ220 (217 mph)</h1>

<p>The XJ220 lost six cylinders and two driven wheels on the way to production, but it still managed to claim the title of fastest production car in 1992.</p>
<p>The original concept version featured a V12 engine and all-wheel drive, but the production model had to make due with a twin-turbocharged V6, and rear-wheel drive. Still, that was enough to get the XJ220 to 217 mph at Nardo, once engineers removed the rev limiter.
However, it wasn't enough to solidify in the car's place in history. Buyers weren't as impressed by the production version as they were with the concept, and a weak early ‘90s economy tanked sales. Sometimes being the fastest just isn't enough.
</p>

<h1>McLaren P1 (217 mph)</h1>
<p>McLaren's successor to the F1 isn't as fast, but it's much more high tech. Its 903-hp hybrid powertrain seamlessly blends electric and turbocharged V8 power, making the P1 one of the most capable performance cars ever made.</p>
<p>During the car's press junket, McLaren said it emphasized the driving experience over outright top speed. Maybe the company didn't think it could compete with Bugatti, or maybe it just thought organ-shredding lateral grip was a
 better way to torture customers than stratospheric speeds.</p>

 
<h1>Ferrari LaFerrari (217 mph)</h1>
<p>Along withe P1 and the Porsche 918 Spyder, the Ferrari LaFerrari is part of a trio of hybrid supercars that showed the world that performance cars don't have to be (too) inefficient.
The Ferrari matches the McLaren for top speed and cleverness. Its 6.3-liter V12 is joined to a hybrid system modeled on the Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) used in Ferrari's Formula One cars. Not only does the LaFerrari give its driver 950 hp to play with, it also provides the instantaneous response of electric motors to get things going.
</p>


<h1>Ferrari Enzo (217 mph)</h1>
<p>That the current LaFerrari isn't any faster than the Enzo that appeared a decade before it could be viewed as proof of lack of progress. Or maybe it's just an indication of how good the Enzo really was.</p>
<p>The Enzo looks positively ancient next to the LaFerrari, but it was state of the supercar art a decade ago. It was the first of Ferrari's flagship hypercars to incorporate Formula 1-style tech, and when it launched it was also the fastest and most powerful production Ferrari to date.
Named after Ferrari's founder, the Enzo's mechanicals and styling set the tone for a generation of Ferrari road cars, and may also represent an important point in supercar development.
With relatively few electronic aids, the Enzo was tricky to drive. A string of crash photos and Youtube videos attested to that. Subsequent Ferraris have included more driver aids, making the Enzo among the last of the analog cars from Maranello.
